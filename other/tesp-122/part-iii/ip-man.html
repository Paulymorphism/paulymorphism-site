            Ip Man 4 tells the story of a Chinese Martial Art (CMA for short) master Ip Man as he moves to San Francisco
            in search of a new life. One theme of the film is how CMA survives racism through the perspective of a CMA
            master. One of the story lines is following a Chinese American soldier trying to introduce CMA to his
            superior who is racist in denial. The superior was seen treating people of color poorly but being respectful
            to fellow white individuals. Another theme is how a lot of Chinese masters of CMA thinks teaching this art
            to other races makes the art less pure. But the relevant moral of the story to the discussion of faith and
            evil is that racism is the evil here. And although the evil is not directly addressed through religion, we
            are shown a very strong faith by the protagonist that he believes at the end of the day, we are all humans,
            so this hatred based on race is unnecessary. This faith is not fueled by religion, but rather a strong
            personal belief.

            This film is the finale of the series. The series takes place around the 40s to the 60s, dealing with topics
            such as Imperial Japanese invasion of China, racism and traditions etcetera. In this particular film, the
            topic is similar to Going to Meet the Man while the first film has largely the same message about wartime
            faith as Night. But the overall message is that under oppression and dehumanizing surroundings, having a
            strong faith will go a long way in fueling once mental and physical strength.
