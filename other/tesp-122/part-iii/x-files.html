            To start with, we take a closer look at the X-File episode. To summarize the plot of the episode, the
            audience follows the protagonist detective to solve a series of murders committed by rattle snakes. The
            episode also establishes two different church organizations that both practice the Christian tradition. On
            one hand, there is O’Connor’s church that faithfully practice the teachings of the Old Testament and take
            all accounts in the scriptures literally. O’Connor himself is a very charismatic person that is able to
            convey his faith effectively to his followers and make them just as faithful. O’Connor’s church was
            primarily practicing the tradition where God is vengeful and very strict with enforcing his commandments. On
            the other hand, Mackey’s church follows a postmodern perspective where God is accepting, and individual
            believers can critique and interpret the text however they want.

            Pausing there, the show’s creators made
            their stances clear by portraying O’Connor’s establishment and practices to be cult-like. And they
            intentionally made the audience feel uneasy when viewing scenes of O’Connor’s church. I think aside from
            being effective in establishing the twist, this portrayal also made it clear that the old practices of
            Christianity have little reason to remain in the modern world. They give the impression of being dated. This
            is exemplified when a scene of the two churches were teaching the same passage. One was shown to be
            following the scripture literally word by word, whereas the other church put the text into historical
            context and allowed individual interpretations. But at the same time, the fact that there is literally a
            snake inhabiting the modern reverend, Mackey’s, body symbolizes that the modern church also has an evil
            within. I think this evil can be interpreted as the church being corrupt under the name of righteousness.
            For example, early in the millennium, there were child molesting scandals, monetarily corrupt churches,
            etcetera. So, I think the writers of this episode is implying that although there is nothing wrong with
            believing in a religion, the traditional practices are dated and the modern organization that supports
            religion can be systematically corrupted and might be contributing the larger evil in society.

        <p class="paragraph">
            As Professor Schlesinger pointed out in my initial assessment of the episode, it is also important to
            recognize that although the 'old ways' are portrayed as dated, it did rescue the main character at the end
            of the day. Further enforcing the idea that religious beliefs and practices are not harmful for the most
            part, but rather the institution that could be problematic.
