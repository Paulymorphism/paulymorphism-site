            Lastly, the episode in Solar Opposites. To give some background for the episode, Solar Opposite is a show
            about an alien family as they emergency landed on earth and their journey to fix the spaceship and keep
            going on their journey. It’s been a running gag where one of the kids Yumyulack will shrink anyone that
            annoys him and store them inside the wall of their house. The gag evolved into a full episode about the
            power hierarchy in the society in the wall and a working-class revolution against the system governed by
            ‘the Duke.’ The revolution was led by a singular worker named Tim who was imprisoned during which his
            cellmate would publicize his ideals to the oppressed workers. The situation is portrayed much like the
            Russian monarchy society before the communist revolution. And after Tim managed to overthrow the current
            monarch, ‘the Duke,’ and discovered that there is a way to escape ‘the wall,’ he chose to rise to power and
            rule the wall. The story has close ties with religion since there is a widespread belief that Jesse, the
            other alien kid, shows mercy and love to the people so it gives everyone hope. ‘The Duke,’ takes advantage
            of the belief and injects his own propaganda into the belief system to mislead the people into believing
            that he’s also good and trustworthy. I think this shows a weakness in religion and faith being taken
            advantage of by a malicious individual or group and one should stay vigilant. For example, ISIS is
            associated with the Islamic belief but has nothing to do with true Islamism. Cults whose sole purpose is to
            take advantage of its faithful believers is still widespread. So, religion can play the role of being part
            of what makes the world evil or support it.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Although it is important to point out that religion is not cause of the injustices in ‘the wall,’ it was
            hijacked to become an enforcer of the regime. And it is also important to recognize that a lot of atheist
            regimes such as China are actively committing violence to suppress religion. Because religion gives people
            strong faith and in the case of the Tibet, this faith works against the government’s agenda. So, faith can
            be a really powerful device that has the power to fuel individual faith or being exploited to carry out evil
            agendas. It depends on if the goal is to build faith or to do evil.
