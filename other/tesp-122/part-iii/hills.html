            To give a little bit of background information, King of the Hill is a show about the Hill family as they
            deal with everyday struggles as they learn lessons from the experiences. This episode focusses on the Hills
            and their Laotian neighbor the Souphanousinphones. The Hills are a family of Christians while the
            Souphanousinphones are a family of Buddhists. One day soon after the Buddhist Lama passed, the
            Souphanousinphones were preparing their daughter Connie to take the test to see if she’s the next Lama and
            compete against another Laotian Buddhist child for that position. Bobby Hill, in an effort to give Connie
            the upper hand, accidentally passed the test and was deemed an unexpected candidate for the next Lama and
            waits for the ultimate test. Finally, during the finale of the episode, Bobby Hill learns that Lama cannot
            marry. Since he’s dating Connie, he chooses Connie instead of being the spiritual leader of millions. A
            couple of key insights are presented in the episode.

            Sees Buddhism as nothing but a tool to gain power, connections and
            leverage over others. He doesn’t go out of his way to practice rituals or learn the teachings of Buddhism.
            As a result, Connie never got a chance to witness a true Buddhist ritual as “there’s no one for [her father]
            to meet” in those Buddhist communities. However, when the monks came to perform the test, he was keen to ask
            the monks to stay at his place. But once he has learned that his daughter will not be selected, he told the
            monks to set up tent in his front lawn.

            <b>Hank Hill (Bobby’s Father):</b>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">A faithful Christian who attends church every Sunday. He interrupts Bobby’s
            enlightenment ritual and tells him the reason why he’s not allowed to practice Buddhism and why they go to
            church every Sunday is because they are Methodist Christians. But when asked what exactly Methodism is, Hank
            failed to provide an answer so has to visit the reverend with Bobby. The answer they got was simply that
            Methodism is a rejection of Calvinism. When the reverend congratulates Bobby on possibly to becoming a Lama,
            he tries to tell the reverend that they are on “the same team.” And refuses to believe that Bobby can be a
            Buddhist and love Jesus, questioning Bobby’s faith to Chrisitanity.

        <p class="paragraph">Follows his father to church every Sunday but seems to not know exactly why they do it,
            similar
            to his father. But when he was led to believe that he’s the reincarnated Lama, he went on a spiritual
            journey and managed to inspire people around him with his ideologies. But, at last, when he learned that
            becoming a Lama will prevent him from following his love, he chose love.

            At first glance, this episode sets out to call out the modern everyday people’s shallowness in their faith
            in the divine and paint a narrative that religion has lost its way in the modern world. But I would argue
            this episode is highlighting the usefulness of religion as a means to discover ourselves. I find this to be
            the most relevant especially given that most people are not thinking about the evils in this world. And more
            importantly, this episode helps highlight an undeniable ‘good’ side of religion in this world with evil.
