            Within the Christian Tradition, faith is generally tied with good. Having faith in Jesus’ teaching entails
            that one is willing to live a life of redemption for their original sin as a human. The Old Testament
            teaches obedience to God is faithful and is considered good. Obedience is also mentioned in the New
            Testament. So, faithfully practicing Christianity in general is considered good.

            However, there are a couple of different arguments around these notions. For example, the Manichees would
            argue that evil stems from a higher being that is equally as powerful as God. So, evil is essentially a God
            that is opposite to the good God. This is a valid argument that acknowledges the coexistent of good and evil
            while highlighting evil is not created by the good God that people worship. The argument is also quite
            convenient and doesn’t offer a great deal of insight into the nature of evil.

            Augustine provided a more interesting account for evil that says evil is not explainable. By this property,
            evil is absurd, so anything that can be explained is automatically good. Using Medea as an example, it’s not
            hard to see that Medea’s actions cannot be logically justified. All of her actions can be explained by
            simply ‘passion.’
