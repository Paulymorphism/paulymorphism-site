            The industrialization has introduced a newfound form of evil that previous accounts didn’t consider that is
            rational, larger in scale and is responsible for hundreds of millions of deaths. This evil has its traces in
            the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, the holocaust and democide. There are absurdities in these massive
            atrocities but if we apply the Augustinian logic to these evils, we more often than not can find a
            justification in the name of ‘progress.’ The Nazi German concentration camps are heavily industrialized
            institutions that treats humans as mere objects because of one person’s ideology. Similar things were
            happening in the east Asian battlefield during World War II where the Imperial Japanese believed that they
            were the best race and therefore should claim all of the world for themselves. In Soviet Russia, Stalin
            implemented policies that are geared towards ‘progress’ but in reality, caused millions of deaths. Same
            thing can be seen in Mao’s China and North Korea.

            Another byproduct of the industrial revolution is that science gains the upper hand in people’s mind over
            religion. Therefore, religion and faith now became irrational for the most part. This sharp turn in what is
            rational places religion and faith in an awkward position. On one hand, there’s the Augustinian view which
            has become integral to the Christian tradition. On the other hand, Augustine also thinks that evil can’t be
            explained. And now religion is falling into the category of being harder to explain using reason.

            Which begs the question, is faith still valid in the modern world?
