            By examining the historical context of evil, we observe a tendency for evil to turn from irrational passion
            to become more rational and justified by certain narratives. I believe this shift indicates that evil is
            neither defined by its irrationality nor by its rationality. Instead, it is characterized for its
            consequence and caused by human’s desire. This is not to say that human desire itself is evil, because
            evolution favors those that are fit for survival. Human developed the desire for more over the course of
            evolution. It brought great progress but also atrocities. On the other hand, faith is also a form of desire,
            the desire for good and spiritual existence higher than oneself. From the portrayals of faith and evil in
            the film media, it seems that religion is a form of faith but also can be a carrier for evil. People
            practicing religious rituals might not entirely get what they are doing it for if they are not experiencing
            great evil. On the other hand, religion can carry strong faith under the existence of evil. However,
            religion is also capable of spreading evil as shown in the X-File episode and the Solar Opposite episode.

            All in all, evil and faith both came from the same root, desire. Religion does have a place in today’s world
            by helping people have stronger faith.
